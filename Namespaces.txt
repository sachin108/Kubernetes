In Kubernetes, namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of 
resources within a single cluster. Names of resources need to be unique 
within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespace-based scoping is 
applicable only for namespaced objects (e.g. Deployments, Services, etc) 
and not for cluster-wide objects (e.g. StorageClass, Nodes, PersistentVolumes, etc).

When to Use Multiple Namespaces
    Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread 
    across multiple teams, or projects. For clusters with a few to tens of 
    users, you should not need to create or think about namespaces at all. 
    
    Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique 
    within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested 
    inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.

Think of a Kubernetes Namespace like a separate "virtual room" within your Kubernetes 
cluster. In this virtual room, you can put different objects (like pods, services, and storage) 
that belong to a specific project, team, or application. Just like how different rooms 
in a house keep things organized and separate, Kubernetes Namespaces help keep your 
applications organized and separate within a shared cluster.

Imagine you're a homeowner (Kubernetes cluster owner) with a big house (cluster) 
where many different people (applications) live. Each person has their own room 
(Namespace) where they can put their belongings (objects). People from one room 
can't easily see or access things in other rooms, making it more private and organized.

So, if you have a web app, a database, and some other services that are part of 
one project, you can put them all in a Namespace named after that project. This way, 
you can work on and manage each project independently without them getting mixed 
up with other projects in the same cluster.

Kubernetes Namespaces help maintain order and separation, making it easier to 
manage multiple applications within a single Kubernetes cluster, just like rooms 
in a house help keep things tidy and separate for different residents.

In a microservices architecture, multiple small services collaborate to create a larger 
application. Running them in a single cluster can simplify communication and management.
