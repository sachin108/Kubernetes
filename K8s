Kubernetes — also known as “k8s” or “kube” — is a container orchestration platform for scheduling and automating the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications.

Orchestration is the coordination and management of multiple computer systems, applications and/or services, stringing together multiple tasks in order to execute a larger workflow or process.

Kubernetes was first developed by engineers at Google before being open sourced in 2014. It is a descendant of Borg, a container orchestration platform used internally at Google. Kubernetes is Greek for helmsman or pilot, hence the helm in the Kubernetes logo (link resides outside of ibm.com).

Today, Kubernetes and the broader container ecosystem are maturing into a general-purpose computing platform and ecosystem that rivals — if not surpasses — virtual machines (VMs) as the basic building blocks of modern cloud infrastructure and applications. This ecosystem enables organizations to deliver a high-productivity Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that addresses multiple infrastructure-related and operations-related tasks and issues surrounding cloud-native development so that development teams can focus solely on coding and innovation.
